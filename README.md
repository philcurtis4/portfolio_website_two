# Portfolio Website for Philip Curtis
## Description
This project was undertaken as part of a coding bootcamp. This is the second challenge of the rutgers bootcamp. We needed to create a portfolio website that has a nav bar that links to the different sections. As well as create a grid for the projects I have created that links to the projects.
